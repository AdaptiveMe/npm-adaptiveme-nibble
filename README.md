### About Adaptive Runtime Platform

Hybrid apps are applications that are built using HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript web technologies and use a native "containers" to package the app to enable access to the native functionalities of a device. In essence, you can write a rich mobile/wearable/tv application using HTML and JavaScript and package that application as a native app for multiple mobile/wearable/tv platforms and distribute them on the different app stores and markets.

The Adaptive Runtime Platform (ARP) provides these native "containers" to package apps for the main mobile, wearable and desktop platforms... and other platforms as they emerge. Adaptive Runtime Platform (ARP) and sub-projects are open-source under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html). The Adaptive Runtime Platform (ARP) project was created by [Carlos Lozano Diez](https://github.com/carloslozano) as part of the [adaptive.me](http://adaptive.me) set of products.
